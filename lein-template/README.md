Modular provides a number of templates to generate Clojure project skeletons with the aim of getting you up-and-running quickly with your own projects.

The command line arguments are

```clojure
lein new modular <your-project-name> <template-to-generate-from>
```

For example

```clojure
lein new modular my-website bootstrap-cover
```

Currently, only bootstrap-cover is supported although many more are on their way.
