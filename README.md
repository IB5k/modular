# modular

Modular provides a meta-architecture for Clojure projects, based on Stuart Sierra's
[component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) library.

Component dependencies form directed acyclic graphs. Two components in a
dependency relationship are coupled using Clojure protocols.

Besides some simple utility functions, modular is defined by a number of
pre-built components which can be composed with custom components to
form application systems.

Modular is an approach, rather than a library or framework.

Benefits include :-

* Components can be reasoned about _in their own terms_ independently from the system
* Component re-use
* Architectural consistency
* Stronger cohesion within parts, weaker coupling between parts

## Usage

```clojure
lein new modular website
```
