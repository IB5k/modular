# modular less

The Less component compiles [Less](http://lesscss.org/) files to CSS.

The project contains a vanilla compiler component and one pre-configured for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) customization

This is demonstrated in the modular's dashboard template, which shows how Bootstrap can be [customized](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/12/customizing-bootstrap/) via Less.

```
lein new modular foo dashboard
```

# Design and develop in the same environment

With this component, it is possible to coordinate development with
designers who can make changes to Less files, run a (reset) and test
their changes against the actual working app.
