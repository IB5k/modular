;; REST

;; For a REST API, it is useful to support both HTTP Basic
;; Authentication (for machines) but to honor cookies passed from a
;; browser in an AJAX call, when the user has logged in via a login
;; form.

;; Here are some utility functions that take a protection domain and
;; return a function which takes a Ring request and returns whether that
;; request is authorized. This is useful to implement the authorizd? decision point in Liberator.
